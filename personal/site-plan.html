      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The homepage is going to consist of the advertisement regarding the website. I am planning to have a 3d animation header for the homepage to render a more minimalistic look to it.
        I want it to be a minimalistic in the sense that it would have the website's description and then a header to be the only things within the homepage. I want this homepage to a place where the 
        viewer will be intruiged to press on the navigations bar out of curiosity and as well as information.

      <h3>Games list</h3>
      <p>
        The games list page would consist of the games that are being reviewed within the website. For now I will only have two games that I am currently putting. But I will be putting more images as
        I continue researching about games. In this page I will putting down the ratings, game title, links to videos, as well as their logos to identify the games. The syle of the page would be a simple
        list styled page. I want this page to be a pretty straight forward page, in which the viewers won't have as much troubles or problems looking for the games they want to see and read about.

      <h3>Games Review</h3>
      <p>
        The Games Review page would consist of the games with its respectable reviews. The reviews are gonna be based on my opnion and verdict of the games.
        This page would be a little confusing since it is the page in which all f the games would have their reviews as well as other informative information about the games.
        Each games would consist of the review, links to youtube videos consisiting of gameplay, a verict, and images of the game.
